Wanes the roaring chaos of the day,

The watchman rests asleep inside his chair,

The lordly darkness floods the grand display,

A solemn bust, his empty eyes do stare.


&nbsp;


At surveillance lens he grimly gawks,

The night owl too with one red stubborn eye.

"Exit", sayeth a buzzing, glowing box,

A suffering set of ventilators sigh.


&nbsp;


No witlings with their proud erudite claim,

Or scholars, grey with wisdom, here will rest

Before the visage, read his noble name

Amid the dazzles of his aged bequest.


&nbsp;


Wherefore hurried gaits of thee don't halt

And to the lord not take a humble bow:

He, whose name refused by fickle lot,

And bless from astral Gods did ne'er endow.


&nbsp;


Do flinty statues, bared from heavy soil

With occultists signed their spells upon

Or engorged ghouls, around the ware they coil

Shall disperse profanity of the throng?


&nbsp;


Yet all beneath the ruin canst one trace

In silent form they writhe their crouching bones.

What from crumbling tomes did time efface

Revived from many carvings on the stones:


&nbsp;


Thy bastion must be fortified and grand,

Along the ridge thy guardsmen do patrol;

In gleaming light of morn they wake and stand,

When night closes in, the curfew gong they toll.


&nbsp;


Thy warriors must be prowess and robust,

The heavy corslet front and back they tog;

Their sanguined spears to foreign villains thrust,

Their callused soles on rugged gravel slog.


&nbsp;


Oft did bellman strike the trilling peal,

A Thamyris, knowledged in pitch and rhyme,

To his air e'en dullest one may seel

And all so softly sing a tuneful hymn.


&nbsp;


On whose scarred back feral whips must lash

So pillars rise to bear your pompous might?

What rouge and powder must turn into ash

When their fair owners fulfill your final rite?


&nbsp;


Your throne was then bequeathed to dearest son,

To gothic house the sceptre did he yield

Then Looted, sullied, stained and stomped upon,

They hunt the puny antler'd on the field.


&nbsp;


Then your name forlorn, your title erred

Lean characters compile your mighty reign,

These words, by fortune could someday be bared,

Through dusty smoke some reads in hapless vain.


&nbsp;


If covers could repel the piercing swords

If the margin could be wider to contain,

If one could leave the stories of the lords

For e'en lesser beings on lesser known domain:


&nbsp;


Of the tomb of Tut, who sealed the knot?

Whose crosses rose by when our debt was paid?

Whose flesh beneath Paris is left to rot?

Of Somerset whose unpitied soul was laid?


&nbsp;


Civis romanus sum, with the fallen sire

My downy wings fettered on the wheel.

Ich bin ein Berliner over barber wire,

Je suis Charlie, no extra blood to spill.


&nbsp;


Who will get your power and the glory?

Who lives, who dies, who tells them of your story?


&nbsp;


What shade of crane is cast on cold lagoon?

What ghost of flora is buried in icy moon?
